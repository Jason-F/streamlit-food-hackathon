A simple Streamlit Component to compare images in Streamlit apps using [Knightlab's JuxtaposeJS](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/). The images are saved to the streamlit `static` directory then served via stremlit as an image overlay with an adjustable slider.

## Development
* Create and activate a venv: `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Run streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`
